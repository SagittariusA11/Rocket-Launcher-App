### Running Play Store app

#### Prerequisites:

-   10-inch Android Tablet

#### Steps:

-   Download and install the app using this  [Play Store link](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.liquidgalaxy.rocket_launcher_app).
-   To connect to the Liquid Galaxy, tap on menu icon and go to Connection Manager; then fill the details similar to below:

![Connection Manager Screen](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SagittariusA11/kml-images_RLA_LiquidGalaxy_GSoC-23/main/3.png)

-   Now simply explore the wide variety of KML visualizations possible through the different Launches data.

### Building from source

#### Prerequisites:

-   Android Studio, Visual Studio Code or another IDE that supports Flutter development
-   Flutter SDK
-   Android SDK
-   Android tablet device or emulator
-   Git

Documentation on how to set up Flutter SDK and its environment can be found  [here](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install). Make sure to have  [Git](https://git-scm.com/)  and  [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/)  installed in your machine before proceeding.

#### Steps:

-   Clone the repository via the following terminal command:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/SagittariusA11/kml-images_RLA_LiquidGalaxy_GSoC-23.git
$ cd Rocket-Launcher-App
```

-   After you have successfully cloned the project, set up Google maps API Key as Rocket Launcher App uses  [Google maps Android API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android-sdk/overview?hl=pt-br)  as the map service. To use Google maps you required an  **API KEY**. To get this key you need to:

1.  Have a Google Account
2.  Create a Google Cloud Project
3.  Open Google Cloud Console
4.  Enable Maps Android SDK
5.  Generate an API KEY

With the key in hands, the next step is placing the key inside the app. Go to  _android/app/main_  and edit the  **AndroidManifest.xml**.

Replace the  **PLACE_HERE_YOUR_API_KEY**  with the key you just created.
```XML
<application
        android:label="lapalmavoltrac"
        android:icon="@mipmap/ic_launcher">
        <meta-data android:name="com.google.android.geo.API_KEY"
            android:value="PLACE_HERE_YOUR_API_KEY"/>
```    

-   To run the code, ppen a terminal and navigate to the project root directory. First you need to install the packages by running:
```bash
$ flutter pub get
```

-   Now we check if our devices are connected and if all the environment is correct by the following terminal command:
```bash
$ flutter doctor
```

-   After this, we run our app by using the following command:

> ❗ Remember that you must have a tablet device connected or an android tablet emulator running in order to run the app.
```bash
$ flutter run
```

-   To build the APK, use the follwoing terminal command:
```bash
$ flutter build apk
```

> ⓘ Once done, the APK file may be found into the  `/build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/`  directory, named  `app-release.apk`.

-   Finally setup the connection with the Liquid Galaxy in the same way as we did previously.

### Setting up the rig

An important step to take is configure the slave screens for refreshing when setting solo KMLs.

To set it up, head to the LG Tasks screen by pressing the menu icon.

In the many buttons present on the LG Tasks screen, you shall see the buttons  `SET SLAVES REFRESH`  and  `RESET SLAVES REFRESH`. The first one will setup your slave screens to refresh its solo KML every 4 seconds. The second one will make your slaves stop refreshing.

> ❗  _Both actions will  **reboot**  your Liquid Galaxy, so the changes may be applied._

## Guide for Open Source Contributors


### To Edit a particular translation

-   Go to JSON file of that particular language, say hi.json in  `assests/i18n folder`  for Hindi.
-   Translate only the data in right as in left is the "key" of the key-value pairs.
-   Send a pull request and you're done.

### To Add a new language

-   If you want to add a new language, say Greek, first google the Language code of the language (for greek it is el).
-   Go to  `assets/i18n`  and add a new file, name it el.json.
-   Copy the contents of en.json and paste it there so you don't have to rewrite the keys.
-   Start translating it and once done, verify it's a JSON of valid format, means no comma or brackets are missing and it has all the key value pairs.
-   Now go to line number #6 of each of the JSON files and add code and language name in each of the languages, you can use google translate here, for single words it's mostly correct.
-   After this go to main.dart and add your language code in a similar way as done for other languages in line #11.
-   Finally go to  `codingapp/translate.dart`  and add the following  **CupertinoActionSheetAction**  code similar to how it is done for other languages,
```dart
   CupertinoActionSheetAction(
            child: Text(translate('language.name.en') + " 🇺🇸",
                style: TextStyle(
                    fontWeight: FontWeight.normal, fontFamily: "GoogleSans")),
            onPressed: () {
              changeLocale(context, "en");
              Navigator.of(context, rootNavigator: true).pop("en");
            }),
```

-   Make sure to change "en" (present at three places) and flag to the language code and flag of the language you're adding.
